# The following parameters have default values. Do not delete them. You can
# also change the values if you want. 

# Each adjacency score is calculated by combining the comparative genomic
# and read scores. And it also has labels for each comparative genomic
# and read score separately. You can set the adjacencies that you want to 
# keep based on those labels.
#
# The label for the comparative genomic score is determined based on the
# amount of support from ingroup and outgroup species as follows.
# CN (None): ingroup = 0 and outgroup = 0 
# CW (Weak): (ingroup = 0 and outgroup > 0) or (ingroup = 1 and outgroup = 0)
# CM (Moderate): (ingroup = 1 and outgroup > 0) or (ingroup = 2 and outgroup = 0)
# CS (Strong): All other cases
#
# The label for the read score is determined based on the position in the
# read coverage distribution.
# RN (None): no read support
# RW (Weak): outside of the range [mean - 2*std, mean + 2*std]
# RM (Moderate): outside of the range [mean - std, mean + std] but inside of the
#             range [mean - 2*std, mean + 2*std]
# RS (Strong): inside of the range [mean - std, mean + std] 
#
# Each adjacency score has a final label by combining the above comparative 
# genomic and read labels, and in the following settings, "yes" means you want to 
# keep the adjacency, and "no" means you don't.
#
# If read data is not used, ignore the read labels and set the same "yes" or "no"
# values for all lines with the same comparative genomic label.

# This parameter is used to provide a file path containing information
# about scaffolds that need to be remain intact (not broken), or need to be
# broken.
#
# Each line in this file needs to have the coordinate of a scaffold with 
# a label representing its status. The followings are example lines.
#
# To make scaffolds remain intact, the following kinds of lines can be
# used. The first line means that there must be no break within scf10 
# (remain intact in the final output). And the second line means that there 
# must be no break within the region from 350000 to 400000 in scf3 
# (the region from 350000 to 400000 remain intact in the final output).
#
# scf10		keep	
# scf3:350000-400000	keep	
#
# To make scaffolds be broken, the following kinds of lines can be used.
# The first line means that if multiple syntenic fragments are created
# in scf17, they must be broken (not adjacent in the final output). The
# second line means that if multiple syntenic fragments are created and 
# their boundaries are within the region from 120000 to 150000 in scf25, 
# they must be broken (not adjacent in the final output).
#
# scf17		break	
# scf25:120000-150000	break	
#
# The keep and break label can be used together for the same scaffold as
# follows. The meaning of each line is the same as explained above.  
#
# scf25:120000-150000 break 
# scf25:300000-350000 keep 
#
# Syntenic fragment (SF) ids can be also used with different labels, 
# break and keep, as shown below. The first line means that SF10  
# must be followed by the inverted SF40 in the final output.  
# And the second line means that SF15 and SF16 must not be adjacent 
# in the final output. Keep in mind that the SF keyword must be shown
# at the front of each line.
#
# SF 10 -40 keep 
# SF 15 16 break
